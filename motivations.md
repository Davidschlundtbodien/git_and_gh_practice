# Motivations

The main motivation for changing my career is the availability to be more flexible in work schedule and work area (remote focus). This fulfills my desire to be closer to my family and future family.

Aside that, I love building and designing projects. Software development is extremely fulfilling to me as well as learning constantly with other developers during collaboration.
